<h1>My Journey...</h1>
<h3>Motivations and things I like</h3>

<p>In my opinion, a person is not only defined by its studies nor its origin. 
Thus, it's important to have an overview of the choices, the experience and the personnality
if you're willing to work with me.</p>

<h4>Here is my story...</h4>

<h4 style="color:red;">Inclure MapMe (interactive maps)</h4>

<h3>I was born in Roubaix, a city part of lille
that is famous for the bike race "Paris - Roubaix".
I stayed all my youth in lille area, moving with my family
and going to high-school. I was raised with this well known culture
from North of France : beeing warm and welcoming to strangers
and loving strong cheeses :)</h3>

<h3> Then, after highschool and two years of
<a href ="#">"Prepa"</a>, I went to Bordeaux to start my studies 
in the </h3><h4>Bordeaux Institute of Technology (INP - Bordeaux)
in the field of Cognitive Sciences.</h4>
<h3></h3>
